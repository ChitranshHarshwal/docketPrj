## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- **`app.py`** â†’ A basic Flask application written in Python.  
- **`requirements.txt`** â†’ Contains the Python libraries required to run the app.  
- **`Dockerfile`** â†’ Instructions to build a Docker image for the Flask app.

host="0.0.0.0" â†’ Makes the Flask app accessible to the outside world (not just inside the container). Without this, it would only be reachable from within the container itself.

port=5000 â†’ Ensures the app listens on port 5000, which is mapped in Docker (-p 5000:5000). This allows you to access it via http://localhost:5000.
